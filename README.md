 # Hi there üëã
 
I am a developer with a keen interest in games. This includes designing systems, like Roblox system and in general just trying to make a great user experience in any Game.

* üî≠ Currently I'm working on Physics, a game that when I can find some time to work on development! It's a game whose goal is to be a puzzle. The idea came after I saw several games about the puzzle, then decided to make one, however, with different thematics than the puzzles already made. It's very early in development at the moment, as I strive to avoid the impulsive nature of Vanguard world and use every new thing that comes out (spoiler: you control the time).
* üí¨ Like all good developers, I have some opinionated preferences about tools and systems. It turns out that anonymous functions should not be used everywhere!
* üå± I am currently learning JavaScript and Python. Currently finishing college.

## Development üñ•Ô∏è

Here are recommendations for starting a game development of my choice, communicated through communities, learning, and study
